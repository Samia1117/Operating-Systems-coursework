This folder contains files that are in a private repository (but are not necessarily confidential). 

The projects are in C or C++ and are mainly centered around understanding tasks of the Operating System such as
Memory Management (Heap Manager), Booting (How OS is initialized by bootloader), architecture of a Filesystem 
(Linux ext2 Filesystem), and most importantly how OS controls concurrency using a Scheduler and thread library 
functions such as thread_lock(), thread_unlock(), thread_signal(), etc. - which are used in multithreaded programs
(Thread Library).
